                    <p>Hi, my name is Ian. In high school, I was really into the idea of being a graffiti artist. I painted in my room and did wheat-pastes about town. A few years later, I realized I was really just into design and creative problem solving.</p>

                    <p className='mt-4 md:mt-10'>Currently, I am a full stack developer and recent graduate from Northwestern University, looking to expand my professional experience as a Full Stack Developer within a fast-paced and quality driven company culture.
                    </p>

                    <p className='mt-4 md:mt-10'>Iâ€™m currently enjoying working with React, Express, Node, NoSQL, GraphQL and RESTful API architectures. For more information, grab a copy of my resume below.</p>
